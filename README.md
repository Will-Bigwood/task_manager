# Task Manager Application
### Introduction
This program allows multiple users to create an account, with a personal username & password, to log into a task management system. The user can add new tasks, view a list of all the tasks, and view a list of their own tasks. 
### Getting Started
To run the code you will need to install Python on your device. The code uses the 'datetime' Python library which may also need to be installed in order to run the code without encountering any errors. You will also need to have the files 'user.txt' and 'tasks.txt' in the same repository as the 'task_manager.py' file for the code to run without error.

At first the only registerd user will be the admin with the following log in credentials:

username - admin

password - adm1n

The admin will need to log in first to create new users by setting up their usernames and passwords. The admin user also has more menu options than regular users. The admin user has the option to 'show statistics' which generates two txt files with information about tasks and users and displays the information on screen.
### Project Overview
Once a user has set up their account with the admin, they can log in and add tasks to the task manager system. The program will ask for inputs such as the task name, description and due date. The user can access a list of all the existing tasks and a list of their own personal tasks. Users can also edit task descriptions, mark tasks as completed, and generate txt files with information about tasks and users. This is a really useful tool for small groups of people or a team of work colleagues to log and track day-to-day tasks in one centralised place.
